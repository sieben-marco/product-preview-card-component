## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) - Block, Element, Modifier

### What I learned

I learned about BEM and Media Queries. I also applied some things that I've learned how layout designs and how to make a web site with mobile-first.

```html
<div class="card">
  <p class="card__price--sale">$149.99</p>
  <p class="card__price--real">$169.99</p>
</div>
```
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  .card {
    width: 80rem;
  }
  .card__image,
  .card__wrapper {
    width: 40rem;
  }
  .card__wrapper {
    padding: 4.6rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep learning about web development and improve my js.
